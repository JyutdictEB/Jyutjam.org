## 1. Introduction

The 1st Forum on Southern China Language (FoSCL-1) was organised by Jyutdict Editorial Board. The basic information of the discussion session is as follows:

Date: July 31, 2021 (Saturday)

Time: 14:30 pm to 17:15 pm

Venue: Online Zoom Meeting

## 2. Objective

We hope that:

(1) To provide a relatively formal platform for the exchange of Lingnaam Jyutjam sounds through annual academic sharing and discussion before (or after) the regular *Pan-Cantonese Offline Meeting*.

(2) To incubate more achievements through regular exchanges.

(3) To demonstrate the power of non-official organisations through this platform.

## 3. Report Form

This forum is a round-table discussion, with each report lasting no more than 30 minutes. The first 5 minutes for a brief description and summary, and the second 25 minutes for a detailed explanation of the content, during which the audience can ask questions and make comments at any time.
