# About us

"Lingnaam Jyutjam" was started in 2017, initially as a QQ group by a group of folk who were keen on studying Yue Language. The original intention of the group was to build a platform for Yue studies lovers.

In the summer of 2018, Jyutdict was prepared for construction and Jyutdict Editorial Board QQ group was subsequently established. As the members of the Editorial Board have all participated to some extent in the writing of Jyutdict and the video production of Lingnaam Jyutjam Bilibili Platform, they are key members of Lingnaam Jyutjam.

At present (2021), the key members of Lingnaam Jyutjam are mainly involved in the following research (not for profit):

- Compile and build a platform for Pan-Cantonese pronunciation query: "[Jyutdict](/en/jyutdict-android/)"
- Making videos on fun facts about Yue: released through "[Bilibili platform](https://space.bilibili.com/410568594)"
- Research on Yue phonetics, phonology and romanization schemes in various places, and design "[Jyutping++ (J++)](/en/j++/)"
- Collect Yue language resources from all over the world

Special Note: As of August 4, 2021, Lingnaam Jyutjam Association has never collaborated with any other organizations or commercial organizations, nor has it issued any donation requests to any outside parties, except for the collaboration [with "Ding Ding Hao Zheng" on the Bilibili platform](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ji4y1L7W6). Please refer to official information (e.g. "[Bilibili platform trend](https://space.bilibili.com/410568594/dynamic)" or this website) to avoid being deceived.
