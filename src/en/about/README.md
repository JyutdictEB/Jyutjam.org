# About us

"Lingnaam Jyutjam" was founded in 2017. It was originally a QQ group founded by a group of folks who are keen to study Yue Language. The original intention of the group was to build a communication platform for Yue studies lovers.

In the summer of 2018, the "Jyutdict" preparations were made, and then the "Jyutdict Editorial Board" QQ group was established. Since the members of the "Editorial Board" have participated in the compilation of "Jyutdict" and the video production of "Lingnaam Jyutjam Bilibili Platform" to a certain extent, they are the main members of "Lingnaam Jyutjam".

At present (2021), the main members of "Lingnaam Jyutjam" mainly have the following research contents (non-profit):

- Compile and build a platform for Pan-Cantonese pronunciation query: "[Jyutdict](/jyutdict-android/)"
- Production of Yue popular science videos: released through "[Bilibili platform](https://space.bilibili.com/410568594)"
- Research on Yue phonetics, phonology and romanization schemes in various places, and design "[Jyutping++ (J++)](/j++/)"
- Collect Yue language resources from all over the world

Special Note: As of now (August 4, 2021), apart from the collaboration [with the "Ding Ding Hao Zheng" on the Bilibili platform](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ji4y1L7W6), "Lingnaam Jyutjam" has never cooperated with any other organization Or the cooperation of commercial organizations, and has never released any donation request. Beware of being deceived, please refer to official information (such as "[Bilibili platform trend](https://space.bilibili.com/410568594/dynamic)" or this site).
