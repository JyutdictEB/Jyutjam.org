# About us

*Lingnaam Jyutjam* was founded in 2017, initially as a group on QQ by fellows who shared a common interest of Yue Language, with the original intention to build a platform for Yue studies lovers.

In the summer of 2018, *Jyutdict* was prepared for construction and another group *Jyutdict Compilation Board* was subsequently established. In this case, the key members of *Lingnaam Jyutjam* could be defined as those in the group *Jyutdict Compilation Board* to contribute to the compilation of *Jyutdict* and furthermore, to the video production on *Lingnaam Jyutjam Bilibili Account* to a certain extent.

At present (2021), the key members of Lingnaam Jyutjam are mainly involved in the following subprojects (not for profit):

- Compilation and building of a online dictionary platform for Pan-Cantonese words including pronunciations and meanings: *[Jyutdict](/en/jyutdict-android/)*
- Videos production on facts about Yue: released on *[Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/410568594)*
- Research on the phonetics, phonology and romanization schemes of Yue varieties and the design of *[Jyutping++ (J++)](/en/j++/)*
- A collection of Yue language resources from all over the world

Special Note: As of August 4, 2021, *Lingnaam Jyutjam Association* has never collaborated with any other commercial or non-commercial organizations, nor has it issued any donation request to any outside partie, except for the collaboration with [*Ding Ding Hao Zheng* on Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ji4y1L7W6). Please refer to official information (e.g. *[Trend on Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/410568594/dynamic)* or this website) to avoid being deceived.
