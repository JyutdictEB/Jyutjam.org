# About Us
## 1. About Lingnaam Jyutjam

*Lingnaam Jyutjam 嶺南粵音* (literally "Phones of Yue Language in Lingnan") was founded in 2017, initially as a QQ group by fellows who shared a common interest of [Yue language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Chinese), with the original intention to build a platform for Yue studies lovers.

In the summer of 2018, *Jyutdict 泛粤典* was prepared for construction and another group *Jyutdict Editorial Board* was subsequently established. In this case, the key members of *Lingnaam Jyutjam* could be defined as those in the group *Jyutdict Editorial Board* to contribute to the compilation of *Jyutdict* and furthermore, to the video production on *Lingnaam Jyutjam Bilibili Account* to a certain extent.

At present (2021), the key members of *Lingnaam Jyutjam* are mainly involved in the following subprojects (not for profit):

- Compilation and building of an online dictionary platform for Pan-Cantonese words including pronunciations and meanings: *[Jyutdict](/en/jyutdict-android/)*
- Videos making of fun facts about Yue: released on *[Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/410568594)*
- Research on the phonetics, phonology and romanization schemes of Yue varieties and the design of *[Jyutping++ (J++)](/en/j++/)*
- Collection of Yue language resources from all over the world

We have been organising our annual [offline meeting](/en/pan-cantonese-offline-meeting/) and [academic forum](/en/folisc/), and [FoLiSC-2](/en/folisc/#folisc-2-open-call-for-papers) in July this year is now open for submissions.

Special Note: As of June 14, 2022, *Lingnaam Jyutjam Association* has never collaborated with any other commercial or non-commercial organizations, nor has it issued any donation requests, except for [ONE video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ji4y1L7W6) with *Dingding Hou Zeng 叮叮好正* on Bilibili. Please refer to official information (e.g. [Trend on *Bilibili*](https://space.bilibili.com/410568594/dynamic) or this website) to avoid being deceived.
